# Some insights about the 50 YouTube channels with the most subscribers 

*By César Heredia, data journalist*

Maybe it’s not entirely a big surprise that T-Series, a music Indian channel, is the profile with the most subscribers on YouTube with 263 million people. T-Series is branded as the largest music record label with up to 35% of the Indian music market. 

As the renowned channel says in its profile description, “T-Series is associated with the music industry from the past three decades, having an ample catalog of music comprising plenty of languages that covers the length & breadth of India.”

The second largest-subscriber channel on YouTube is the American entrepreneur and Internet personality MrBeast. with a community of more than 250 million followers. 

It is no coincidence that these profiles come from India and the United States. These two countries gather at least 60% of the 50 YouTube channels with the most subscribers through April 14, 2024.

But here is the thing. Despite India having 36% of the 50 most subscribed YouTube channels, **the most spoken language within the Big 50 on YouTube is English**.

24 of the 50 YouTube channels with the most subscribers target English speakers (exactly 42%). Those channels gather 1,84 billion subscribers, while Indian-speaking channels collect 1,51 billion subscribers.

The Korean language lies in third place with a distant 6%. A curious thing is that **75% of South Korean channels have English as their primary language, not Korean**.

Cyprus, Sweden, and Romania, all of them European countries, **are also English-speaking channels**.

The only Portuguese-spoken channel comes from Brazil: Canal Kondzilla, with 67 million subscribers.

Russian-speaking Entertainment channels A4 and Get Movies have a media of 51,65 million subscribers. Both occupy the 42nd and 47th positions, respectively.

Among the main topics, **80% of the 50 most subscribed YouTube channels are labeled as Music (42%) or Entertainment (38%)**. Those are followed by Education (8%), Sports and Film (4% each), News and How-to (2% each).
